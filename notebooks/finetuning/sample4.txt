Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the address_components. We start by identifying the key elements of the address:

1. house number: The address begins with '86', which is typically indicative of a house or building number.
2. society name: Following the house number, 'SHTRAPAL SOSAYTE' appears to be the name of the society or complex. The spelling 'SOSAYTE' suggests a phonetic spelling of 'Society'.
3. locality: 'BAMROLI' is mentioned next, which seems to be the locality or area within the city.
4. city: The city is mentioned twice as 'Surat', which confirms the city name.
5. state: 'Gujarat' is clearly stated as the state.
6. pincode: '394221' is provided at the end, which is a standard format for postal codes in India.

Output components should ensure that all relevant information from the input address is captured without repetition, irrelevant details are filtered out, and each component is correctly identified and labeled.
