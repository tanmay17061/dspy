66, DIST AMARAVAT 702 NITIN THAKUR TEH - DHARNI Pune Pune Maharashtra 410506
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the address_components. We start by identifying the key elements of the address:

1. house number: The address begins with '66,' which is typically indicative of a house number.
2. district: The term 'DIST' suggests that 'AMARAVAT' is the district name.
3. person name: 'NITIN THAKUR' appears to be the name of a person, which is not typically a part of the address components we need to extract.
4. tehsil: 'TEH - DHARNI' indicates the tehsil or sub-district.
5. city: The city is mentioned twice as 'Pune'. We need to ensure this is not repeated in our components.
6. state: 'Maharashtra' is clearly the state.
7. pincode: '410506' is the postal code.

Next, we filter out any irrelevant or redundant information:
- The repetition of 'Pune' is noted, and only one instance is needed.
- '702' appears to be a spurious number with no clear relevance to the address structure typically used in India.

Now, we can construct the JSON object with the parsed components, ensuring no repetition, maintaining completeness, filtering out irrelevant data, and ensuring correctness.
