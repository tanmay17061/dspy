Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the address_components. We start by identifying and separating the distinct parts of the address:

1. house number: The address mentions 'hn 96' which clearly indicates the house number. We also see '3 d/o mohd hasan' which seems to be additional information possibly related to a person rather than the house number itself.

2. city: The address ends with 'Vikasnagar Dehradun Dehradun'. Here, 'Vikasnagar' could be considered a locality or part of the city, while 'Dehradun' is repeated, indicating it is the main city.

3. state: 'Uttaranchal' (now known as Uttarakhand) is mentioned, which is the state.

4. pincode: '248125' is clearly the pincode.

5. locality: 'ambari Jeevangarh' appears twice, suggesting it is an important part of the locality description. 'Jiwangarh' seems to be a misspelling or incorrect repetition of 'Jeevangarh'.

6. landmark: 'jeevangarh' is mentioned multiple times, indicating it is a significant landmark or area.

7. care of: '3 d/o mohd hasan' suggests that the address might be in care of 'mohd hasan'.

By analyzing the address, we ensure that we do not repeat information, all critical information is included, irrelevant repetitions and possible errors are filtered out, and each component is correctly identified.
