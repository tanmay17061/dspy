The first thing we notice is that there are multiple spaces between words. This can be ignored because it doesn't affect our understanding of what each word means. Next, let's look at each individual word in turn: chandra nagar: this could refer to either the house number or street name; however, since we don't know which one it is referring too without more context (like seeing another address), I'll leave it blank for now. thakur mohlla koteswar mandir: these three words together form a single phrase that describes where this house is located. Since there isn't any other information available about the location, we can just use those three words as our \"city\" component. Gwalior: again, since we don't know whether this refers to the city or state without more context (like seeing another address), I'll leave it blank for now. Madhya Pradesh: finally, we have a clear indication that this is indeed referring to the state. Therefore, let's use \"Madhya Pradesh\" as our \"state\" component.
