Policy Standards\\n\\n    1.  Patch Management\\n\\n-   AWS Linux Servers in Dev, Test and Production Environment\\n\\n    -   AWS inspector detects if patch update is required. AWS Machine\\n          Image (AMI) is created and deployed manually once a patch is\\n          available.\\n\\n    -   Patches need not be tested in ‘Test Environment’ prior to\\n          deployment. AWS tests patches before they are made available.\\n\\n-   FinBox Applications\\n\\n    -   Patches are deployed as and when vulnerabilities are found.\\n\\n    -   Code is not Operating System specific, and hence end-user\\n          operations are not impacted during patch deployment\\n\\n-   Database\\n\\n    -   Patches are updated manually.\\n\\n-   End-user devices\\n\\n    -   Patches on the laptop are installed through the internet once\\n          they are available.\\n\\n    -   MDM solution is implemented to monitor if the latest patch for\\n          Operating System is deployed on all laptops.\\n\\n-   Office Firewall\\n\\n    -   FinBox does not host any physical servers.

This Firewall is patched as and\\n          when patches are available.\\n\\n-   All critical patches in AWS Infrastructure and End User’s devices\\n      are deployed within 30 days once they are available.\\n\\n    1.  Vulnerability Scans and Penetration tests \\n\\n-   Vulnerability Scans and Penetration Tests are planned during\\n      downtime. Customers are informed in advance about the downtime.\\n\\n-   Whenever high-risk vulnerability is identified in any system, the\\n      concerned team is notified immediately to start the remediation\\n      action or provide justification if the fix is not applicable, and\\n      a new remediation scan is conducted.\\n\\n    1.

List of\\n  approved software is maintained by Chief Information Security Officer.\\n\\n  Additional software usage requires team lead’s approval. MDM solutions\\n  send alert if any malicious software is being installed.\\n\\nExternal Media\\n\\n  Any external media such as CD-ROMs, DVDs and other removable storage\\n  media are not permitted and blocked.\\n\\nHandling Malicious Code\\n\\n-   Approved Anti-virus solutions are deployed at all end user devices.\\n      Daily scans are performed.\\n\\n-   Status of security patch updates and Anti-virus definition updates\\n      are monitored through approved MDM solutions.\\n\\n-   If users suspect infection by a virus, they must immediately stop\\n      using and shut down the involved computer and call the CISO. Users\\n      must not intentionally write, compile, copy, propagate, execute or\\n      attempt to introduce any computer code into the Finbox systems\\n      under any circumstances.\\n\\n    1.  End-of-life resources\\n\\n  All operating systems, database management systems versions and any\\n  other assets are replaced before they reach their respective End of\\n  Life (EOL) or End of Support (EOS) dates.\\n\\n2.  Guidelines\\n\\n    1.  Guidelines for the System Administrator\\n\\n-   All employees should be instructed to take approval from team lead\\n      before downloading any software.\\n\\n-   Monitor the dashboards and alerts provided by MDM solutions to\\n      ensure that security patches are up-to-date and if any\\n      unauthorised software is installed in the system.\\n\\n    1.  Guidelines for the Users\\n\\n-   Users shall not install freeware /shareware/non-standard software’s\\n      or unlicensed programs onto their systems.\\n\\n-   Users shall not use any Messenger software and if they are using it\\n      as a part of business requirements then they must not transfer any\\n      files using the messenger.\\n\\n-   Inform the CISO for any unusual activities on your systems.\\n\\n-   Reboot their system once in a day (preferably after arriving to the\\n      workplace) to keep their antivirus pattern file updated.\\n\\n-   Ensure security patches are accepted as they are made available by\\n      the operating system\\n\\n-   Every storage media shall be scanned for viruses before use.\\n\\n    1.
